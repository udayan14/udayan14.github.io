I am a $2^{nd}$ year masters student at UC San Diego.

I completed my bachelors in CSE from [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2019. My undergraduate thesis was titled **Greedy Algorithms for Non-Negative Non-Linear Sparse Regression** and was advised by [Prof. Ajit Rajwade](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/). I also earned a minor degree in Mathematics.
