I am a $2^{nd}$ year masters student at UC San Diego.

I completed my bachelors in CSE from [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2019. My undergraduate thesis was titled **Greedy Algorithms for Non-Negative Non-Linear Sparse Regression** and was advised by [Prof. Ajit Rajwade](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/). I also earned a minor degree in Mathematics.

I am learning the [bansuri](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bansuri) and love listening to Indian Classical Music. I am always on the lookout for compositions and performances new to me. Do message me if you find any amazing performance/concert.

Competitive Programming is one of my new found hobbies. I am just a beginner and am trying to improve. Here are my [codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/udayan14) and [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/udayan14) profiles. I also used to solve Project Euler problems, hopefully I will get back to solving them.


I have used [this](https://academicpages.github.io/) template to make my website. Follow the instructions. Its very easy.
