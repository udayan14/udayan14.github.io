I was a TA for a course title Calculus at IIT Bombay. The course is meant for freshmen students. This course deals with proofs of all the calculus students use offhandedly in their JEE preparation, and later covers some multivariable calculus. In general, many students struggle with this course.
The course instructor was [Prof A.K. Pani](http://www.math.iitb.ac.in/~akp/).

My duties included holding office hours and discussion sections, as well as grading quizzes and invigilating exams.
This was my first ever Teaching Assistant job and I learnt a lot from this experience.
