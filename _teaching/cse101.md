I was a TA for CS101, an introductory course in Programming at IIT Bombay. The course is meant for freshmen students. The course uses C/C++ to introduce students to the beautiful world of programming. The course starts slow, but has a steep learning curve. This is especially true whenever we get to the topic of recursion. Most of the course is just C programming, with STL introduced at the very end.
The course instructor was [Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/).

My duties included creating problems for the weekly labs, making testcases and writing solutions. Different TAs served as the setter, tester and the model solution writer in a circular fashion. Other duties included helping students with their doubts during the actual lab and invigilating in exams.

In all honesty, we should have made easier problems for the students in the labs, rather than assuming full knowledge of the previous week's lab.
