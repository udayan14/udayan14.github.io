I was a TA for CSE150A, an course in AI at UC San Diego. This is an upper division course, which was being taught in the summer session. The course mainly deals with looking at Machine Learning as a whole from a probabilistic angle. The course starts with basics of Probability Theory, then covers inference and learning in Bayesian Networks in that order. The course finally ends with a brief introduction to Reinforcement Learning.
The course instructor was [Joseph Geumlek](https://dblp.org/pid/177/9076.html).

My duties included holding office hours every week and one discussion section, and grading homework and quizzes.
This course is a watered down version of CSE250A. The questions are very easy and almost all calculus has been avoided. Its a very enjoyable course and highly recommended
